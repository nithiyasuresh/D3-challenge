2. Next step was to create an SVG wrapper, append an SVG group that will hold our chart, and shift the latter by left and top margins.
3. Next was to import data, and do the below steps.
      1. Parse data
      2. Create scale functions.
      3. Create axis function.
      4. Append axes to the chart.
      5. Create circles.
      6. Create text group.
      7. Initialise tool tip.
      8. Create tooltip in the chart.
      9. Create event listener to display and hide the tooltip.
 4. Amended the index.html, to create a heading, and paragraph info, to display when the page is loaded.
